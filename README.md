Task-4
  
    
  Summary
      
      We made a Sales table with product name, category, quantity, and price.
      
      Added data for Electronics, Furniture, and Fashion.
      
      Used:
      
      SUM → total sales
      
      COUNT → number of products
      
      AVG → average price
      
      GROUP BY → to get results category-wise
      
      HAVING → to show only categories with sales above ₹50,000

 Analysis
             
       Electronics → Highest sales because products are expensive.
              
       Furniture → Medium sales, fewer items but decent price.
              
       Fashion → Low price per item but sells in large quantity.

Takeaway:
          
    Aggregate functions help quickly summarize and compare data across groups, so you can see which category is performing best.

File Included:

    Aggregate Functions and Grouping(Task-4).sql - SQL  for Aggregate Functions and Grouping to manage the data in table.
